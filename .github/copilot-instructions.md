# GitHub Copilot instructions

## Writing Text

- Never use emojis in any text.
- Use clear, conversational language that builds understanding progressively
- Start with the "what" and "why" before diving into technical details
- Structure content with logical flow: introduction → concepts → implementation → next steps
- Use **bold formatting** for key terms and concepts when first introduced
- Provide concrete examples that relate to the reader's context (.NET developers)
- Include practical benefits and real-world applications
- Use active voice and direct statements ("OpenAPI solves..." not "Problems can be solved by OpenAPI")
- Create smooth transitions between sections that maintain narrative flow
- Focus on practical value and actionable information over theoretical concepts
- Use consistent formatting for code examples, file paths, and technical terms
